## About
Classic game of chess. This is a functional chessboard with all the pieces and a manual mouse picking mechanic.
No other functionality, just a prototype of a chessboard. Created with Pygame.

## Functionality
- Chessboard is built from scratch with the images of sqaures in the 'graphics' folder.
- The program creates dictionaries with all the x and y values for squares and positions for pieces.
- Pieces from the 'graphics' folder are drawn on the chessboard to their initial positions.
- Game can be operated with mouse drag & drop mechanic.
- The program checks for a collision if trying to drop a piece onto another piece.
- There is also a snap mechanic, so the dropped piece centers itself onto the corresponding square under the mouse cursor.

## Installation
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Use pip to install all required packages listed in requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt).
- Execute the main script to run the program (python main.py).
